# Project Title
 
Mini project 3: Webpages in Flask

## Description
 
This is a webpage built using Flask and Bootstrap that I thought would be fun to build out for my tabletop gaming server to have a single place for getting files, links, etc.

## Getting Started

### Installing
 
Download the files from this repository. In a terminal, navigate to the downloaded folder.

## Downloading Dependencies
 
Package requirements are in the requirements.txt file. To install, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 
### Executing program

* First, initialize the SQL database by running:
```
flask --app tabletoplocal init-db
```
* Then start the webserver:
```
flask --app tabletoplocal run
```
The webpage will then be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000
